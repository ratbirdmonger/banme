## Basics
* Cactuar fusing
* Configurable chaining

## Programming constructs
* You can program in which abilities to use for which unit, on a turn by turn basis, then choose the timing that they use to activate.
* "Wait for X condition" logic, for example in arena I send 3 chainers, and wait for esper gauge to be filled, so when it's ready I can summon Odin during the chain.
* For battles, it selects your party with the name you specify (Raid, MK, etc.), then attempts to find bonus units on your friend list. Use the predefined actions you program in.

## Daily bullshit clearing
* Buy the cactaur bundle. Double checks in place to make sure the wrong bundle doesn't get picked!
* Send/receive gifts, click the share button
* *Watch 7 ads - I will not publish the code for this because circumventing ads is a huge deal for ad exchanges and their partners. But I will give some hints - it works by doing image analysis on both corners of the screen to determine which one is most likely the X button. 

## Hourly bullshit clearing
* Claim completed expeditions, launch new ones.
* Check for raid orbs, use them up. Executes whatever sequence you program in.
* Check for arena orbs, use them up. Executes whatever sequence you program in.
* If there's energy left, do some MK farming or insignia farming
	
## To do
* 3/4\* unit fusing. 
    * Not hard but will be a slow-running script: Click each unit and see if there are any "Trust up" units when you go to select units to fuse.
